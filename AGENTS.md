# Agent Notes

- `.dotfiles` is the desktop repo; `.dotfiles-wsl` is the source of truth for common/CLI config.
- Keep common files aligned with WSL; keep desktop configs here.
- Do not delete without a backup: move retired items into `legacy/` and document.
- Record verification steps in `docs/VERIFY.md`.
- Keep commits small and reviewable; never commit secrets.
